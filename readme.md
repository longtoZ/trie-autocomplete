# Trie in Autocomplete

*This is a project in Data Structures and Algorithms course at University of Science, VNU-HCM. The project is about implementing a Trie data structure to support autocomplete like some search engines.*

## 1. Features
### 1.1. Classic
- Insert a word
- Remove a word
- Search a word
- Suggest a list of words that have the same prefix

### 1.2. Advanced
- Execution time improvement using cache.
- Search using regular expression (only support `.`, `^` and `[]`).
- Fuzzy search (search a word that is similar to the input word).

## 2. Comparison with Sorted Array
- Measure execution time of each operation in both Trie and Sorted Array.
- Compare the number of comparisons in each operation in both Trie and Sorted Array.
- Read more in the report.

## 3. Documentation and presentation
